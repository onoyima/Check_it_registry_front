    title: 'Device Fingerprinting for Fraud Prevention',
    content: `During device checks and certain security-sensitive operations, we collect device fingerprint data. This is NOT a traditional cookie but rather a JavaScript-based identification technique used for fraud prevention.

• Browser plugin list
• Screen resolution and color depth
• Timezone and language settings
• Font list
• Platform and user agent information

This data is used exclusively to:
• Prevent automated abuse of the device check system

• Protect against bot attacks
• Ensure fair usage of free tier services

Retention: Device fingerprint data is retained for 30 days and is stored separately from your personal account data. It is used only for fraud detection and is not shared with third parties.

You may disable JavaScript to prevent fingerprint collection, but this will prevent the device check service from functioning properly.`
